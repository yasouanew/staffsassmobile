/**
 * Horizontal day selector carousel.
 *
 * ## Why this is a `FlatList` and not a `View` with `.map`
 *
 * Seven items fit on screen, so a virtualised list buys nothing here *today*.
 * It is still a `FlatList` for three reasons that all survive that observation:
 *
 * 1. **It is the mandated architecture** (V1). If this screen later grows a
 *    two-week or month strip, the scroll engine is already correct and the only
 *    change is the data feeding it.
 * 2. **`getItemLayout` makes the horizontal scroll jump-free.** A day strip is
 *    the one place in the app where tapping "next day" should scroll
 *    programmatically; without measured offsets that scroll is a guess.
 * 3. **Windowing keeps `initialNumToRender` explicit**, which is the difference
 *    between a defined first frame and an accidental one.
 *
 * ## Why every cell is rendered immediately
 *
 * `initialNumToRender = DAYS_PER_WEEK` is deliberate, not a default left
 * unset. Seven cells are always visible, so deferring any of them would
 * produce a visibly empty strip for one frame. `windowSize = 1` is safe
 * *because* everything fits: there is no off-screen tail to pre-render.
 *
 * ## Why the active dot is always mounted
 *
 * The dot marks the selected day. Rendering it conditionally would change the
 * cell's inner height when selection moves, so the row would jump by the dot's
 * height on every tap. It is instead always present at `opacity: 0` and only
 * its opacity changes — the same reserved-space technique the auth screens use
 * for the password strength meter, and the reason `CELL_HEIGHT` is a constant
 * that `getItemLayout` can rely on.
 *
 * ## Layout maths
 *
 * Cell width is derived, never guessed. The strip shows seven gutters between
 * eight cell edges across the content width, so:
 *
 * ```
 * cell = (contentWidth - (DAYS_PER_WEEK - 1) * GAP) / DAYS_PER_WEEK
 * ```
 *
 * `contentWidth` is `min(screenWidth, maxContentWidth)` so the strip is
 * identical on a phone and on a tablet, where the rest of the app is capped by
 * `layout.maxContentWidth`.
