/**
 * Paywall interstitial for a locked company (expired trial / inactive subscription).
 *
 * The backend's `company.access` middleware answers 403 for essentially every
 * company-scoped endpoint while the account is locked, so a signed-in user would
 * otherwise land in a shell where every tab shows the same "forbidden" error. This
 * view replaces that dead end with an explanation and a single exit.
 *
 * It deliberately offers **no** "try again" or upgrade CTA: paying is an admin task
 * performed on the web, and this app has no billing surface. Promising an action the
 * app cannot perform would be worse than saying nothing.
 *
 * `reason` comes from the API when present and is shown verbatim — it is already
 * operator-facing copy, and paraphrasing it risks contradicting the message the
 * company's admin sees elsewhere.
