/**
 * Keyboard-aware screen shell for form screens.
 *
 * [`ScreenContainer`](src/components/ScreenContainer/ScreenContainer.tsx:1) deliberately
 * does *not* avoid the keyboard — it only makes the scroll view tolerant of taps
 * landing on a button while the keyboard is open. On a short phone that is not
 * enough: a focused field near the bottom of the form ends up underneath the
 * keyboard with no way to see what is being typed.
 *
 * This container closes that gap. It owns three things:
 *
 * 1. **Platform-correct avoidance.** `padding` on iOS, `height` on Android.
 *    Swapping them is a classic bug: iOS `height` collapses the scroller so it can
 *    no longer reveal the focused field; Android `height` double-counts the resize
 *    the OS already performed via `adjustResize`.
 * 2. **Scroll-into-view on focus.** Fields register themselves through
 *    [`useKeyboardAwareField`](#), which reports the field's measured `y`. On focus
 *    the container scrolls that offset above the keyboard. Offsets are *measured*,
 *    never hard-coded — a hard-coded offset is wrong the moment a hero block or a
 *    helper line changes the form's height.
 * 3. **The bottom safe-area inset.** Applied as extra tail padding on the scroller,
 *    so the submit button clears the home indicator. The inner
 *    [`ScreenContainer`](src/components/ScreenContainer/ScreenContainer.tsx:1) is
 *    rendered with `withBottomInset={false}` so exactly one component owns it.
 *
 * Two rules for call sites:
 *
 * - **Never nest two of these.** Compounded padding is worse than no avoidance.
 * - **Do not put one inside a screen that already has a native header** without
 *   setting `keyboardVerticalOffset` to that header's height.

/**
 * Instance type exposed by `ScrollView` in React Native 0.87. The component's
 * own type is a function with statics, so `useRef<ScrollView>` yields the wrong

 * [`AppTextInput`](src/components/AppTextInput/AppTextInput.tsx:18) uses for
 * `TextInput`.
