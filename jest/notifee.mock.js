/**
 * Jest mock for `@notifee/react-native`.
 *
 * The package resolves to a TurboModule that only exists inside a real native build,
 * so importing it under Jest throws. `pushService` imports it lazily (only on Android,
 * only once push is configured), but a test that exercises `initializePushService` with
 * `FCM_ENABLED` mocked to `true` would still reach it — hence this stub.
 *
 * `createChannel` is the only API this app calls.
