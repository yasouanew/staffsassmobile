/**
 * Elevation tokens — "soft elevation".
 *
 * Philosophy
 * ----------
 * Shadows here describe *depth*, not decoration. A surface gets a shadow
 * because it floats above the page (header, sheet, FAB, popover) — static cards
 * on a scroll view use a hairline border plus a slightly lighter surface
 * instead. Overshadowing is the fastest way to make a business app look dated.
 *
 * Modelling
 * ---------
 * Every tier is defined as *numbers*, not as a CSS string, so the same
 * definition can be handed to either platform's native shadow API:
 *
 *   - iOS     → `shadowColor` / `shadowOffset {width,height}` / `shadowRadius` /
 *               `shadowOpacity`. All point-based; the offset and radius are
 *               real pt values, and opacity is a 0–1 float.
 *   - Android → `elevation<f>` plus `shadowColor`. Android derives the blur and
 *               offset from the elevation integer and the view's Z position, so
 *               only the elevation step and the tint are forwarded.
 *
 * `blurRadius` and `offsetY` are declared once in `elevationSpecs` — the
 * mathematical source of truth — and then *translated* per platform below. No
 * call site ever branches on `Platform.OS`.
 *
 * Depth reads as: bigger offset + bigger blur + lower opacity = further away.
 * The opacity ceiling is deliberately low (max 0.14) because a hard shadow on a
 * light blue canvas looks like a rendering artefact.
