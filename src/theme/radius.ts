/**
 * Corner radius rules.
 *
 * Radii are grouped by the *kind of object* they apply to, not by pixel size —
 * because the failure mode on mobile is a card that is 12pt on one screen and
 * 16pt on another, not a card that is 12pt instead of 13pt. Pick the role, get
 * the value.
 *
 *  - `micro`  — objects inside another object: chips, tags, inline inputs,
 *               small status pills. Must be small enough that a nested element
 *               never curves more sharply than its container.
 *  - `macro`  — objects that sit on the page: cards, bottom sheets, modals.
 *               Large enough to read as deliberately soft.
 *  - `pill`   — shape carries meaning: badges, avatars, filter toggles, FABs,
 *               icon buttons. Always fully rounded.
 *
 * All values are point-based integers. `pill` is a large sentinel rather than
 * a percentage because React Native's `borderRadius` is a point value and the
 * sentinel behaviour clamps correctly on both platforms.
