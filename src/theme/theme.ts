/**
 * The application theme.
 *
 * Shape
 * -----
 * One theme per colour scheme, built by the same factory so the two are
 * guaranteed to have identical structure. `Theme` is the type of the *result*,
 * which means every component that typed against the old single theme object
 * still typechecks — it just resolves to whichever scheme is active.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   `theme.spacing.md`, `theme.colors.textSecondary`,
 *   `theme.typography.variants.headerMedium`, `theme.shadows.low`.
 *
 * Why a plain object and not a React context holds the tokens
 * -----------------------------------------------------------
 * The token *values* are static data, so they live outside React. Only the
 * *selection* between them is reactive, and that selection happens in
 * [`useTheme`](src/theme/useTheme.ts:1) via the OS colour-scheme signal. This
 * keeps tokens importable from non-render code (navigation options, style
 * factories) while still allowing a component to re-render on scheme change.
 *
 * Typography note: variant colours are pinned to the *light* palette inside
 * [`typography.ts`](src/theme/typography.ts:1) because a text style is a static
 * constant. Components that need scheme-correct text colour either let
 * `AppText` apply the scheme's `colors.text*` tokens, or pass an explicit
 * `color` token — see [`AppText`](src/components/AppText/AppText.tsx:1).
