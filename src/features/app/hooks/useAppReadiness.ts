/**
 * App boot readiness.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the global `isAppReady` boolean that the app-level
 * [`SplashScreen`](src/components/SplashScreen/SplashScreen.tsx:1) remains visible
 * behind. The splash is dismissed when — and only when — three independent
 * conditions are all satisfied, each mapping onto a distinct failure mode:
 *
 * | # | Condition | Subscribes to | Without it |
 * |---|-----------|---------------|------------|
 * | 1 | **Auth token validated** — never show an authenticated shell against an unvalidated or revoked token | `useSessionStore.status` | A revoked/deactivated account briefly renders the dashboard and is then torn down mid-paint. |
 * | 2 | **Initial roster data settled** — first network fan-out for the landing content has resolved (success *or* failure) | `useShifts` for today | The dashboard paints its skeleton and then visibly re-flows when data lands. |
 * | 3 | **Core layout mounted** — the navigator subtree has committed at least one frame | a `useEffect` mount flag in the gate | A cross-fade to a not-yet-laid-out tree flashes for one frame. |
 *
 * ## Why condition 2 is "settled", not "succeeded"
 *
 * Waiting for *success* would strand an offline user on the splash forever — the
 * app must be usable with cached data and a retry affordance, which every screen
 * already provides through `ErrorView`/`QueryState`. So the gate opens the moment
 * the query is no longer pending, and the error surfaces **inside** the dashboard
 * where it can be retried. That is the one place this hook intentionally diverges
 * from a naive reading of "requests complete successfully", and it is what makes
 * the splash impossible to get stuck behind.
 *
 * ## Why the roster query is only *observed* here
 *
 * `useShifts` is safe to call alongside the screen that owns the same query: TanStack
 * Query dedupes by key, so this observer shares the exact in-flight request rather
 * than issuing a second one. The hook therefore costs one subscriber, not one HTTP
 * round trip.
