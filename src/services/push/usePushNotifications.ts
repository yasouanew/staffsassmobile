/**
 * Binds the push service to the app lifecycle.
 *
 * Mounted once, in the root component. It reacts to two things:
 *
 * 1. **Session status** — registering only makes sense while authenticated, and
 *    signing out must unregister so the next user of the device is not notified
 *    about the previous user's shifts.
 * 2. **The push preference** — toggling the Settings switch should take effect
 *    immediately rather than at next launch.
 *
 * Incoming messages do two things: they are written to the local inbox (in the
 * service, so it also works headless) and they invalidate the notification and shift
 * queries. Invalidation is the one piece of app knowledge the service layer is not
 * allowed to hold, so it lives here: a shift being published server-side is the main
 * reason this app receives push at all, and refetching is the correct, idempotent
 * response.
