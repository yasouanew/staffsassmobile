/**
 * Screen shell.
 *
 * Owns the three things every screen would otherwise get subtly wrong:
 *
 * 1. **Safe area** — see the two ownership modes below.
 * 2. **Keyboard avoidance** — `keyboardShouldPersistTaps="handled"` lets a user tap
 *    a submit button while the keyboard is open, instead of the first tap only
 *    dismissing the keyboard.
 * 3. **Consistent gutter** — one horizontal padding value shared with
 *    [`AppHeader`](src/components/AppHeader/AppHeader.tsx:1).
 *
 * `scrollable={false}` renders a plain flex view for screens that manage their own
 * list (FlatList), which must not be nested inside a ScrollView.
 *
 * ## Who owns the top inset
 *
 * Exactly one thing, in one of two modes:
 *
 * ```
 *  hasHeader={false}                        hasHeader={true}
 *  ┌─── scroller decides ───┐               ┌───────────────┐
 *  │  paddingTop = inset.top│               │ AppHeader     │ ← absorbs inset.top
 *  ├────────────────────────┤               ├───────────────┤
 *  │  paddingBottom =       │               │ scroll view   │ ← no top inset here
 *  │  inset.bottom          │               │ paddingBottom │
 *  └────────────────────────┘               └───────────────┘
 * ```
 *
 * Mode A: no header, so the container adds `insets.top` itself — otherwise content
 * begins under the status bar. `paddingTop` lives on the **content container**, so
 * scrolling text disappears under the transparent status bar exactly as it should,
 * rather than being cut off at a hard boundary. There is no `SafeAreaView` on this
 * path on purpose: a background-coloured `SafeAreaView` in front of a scroller
 * paints an opaque band that moving content cannot pass beneath, which is a worse
 * artefact than the one it prevents.
 *
 * Mode B: a header is present and has already absorbed the inset, so the container
 * contributes **zero** top padding and `paddingTop` is measurably 0. Note what it
 * does *not* do: it does not set `paddingTop = measuredHeaderHeight`. The header is
 * a sibling of the scroller in a column, so it already occupies that space in
 * layout; adding the equivalent padding again would push the first row down by a
 * whole header height. The measured height is only useful to a **tab screen** whose
 * scroller sits underneath a screen-level sticky header, and that case is opted
 * into explicitly with `headerHeight`.
 *
 * ## Scroll viewport boundaries
 *
 * The brief's "scroll text must fade under the header rather than slide behind the
 * battery icon" requirement is met by **structure, not by a clip flag**:
 *
 *  - Under a sibling header, the scroller is a flow child of a column that starts
 *    *below* it, so it is bounded at the header's measured lower edge by layout.
 *    There is no scroll offset that can put a row behind the status bar, so no
 *    clipping is required and none is applied.
 *  - The scrollable path adds `paddingTop` to the **content container** instead of
 *    wrapping in a `SafeAreaView`, so content does travel under the transparent
 *    status bar as it scrolls and then leaves the viewport cleanly. An
 *    opaque `SafeAreaView` in front of a scroller would instead paint a permanent
 *    dead band that moving content cannot pass beneath.
 *
 * `clipsToBounds` is deliberately **not** passed even though iOS supports it: it is
 * a `UIView` property with no entry in RN's `ScrollViewProps`, so supplying it would
 * be an untyped prop that a future RN release could rename or reject silently.
 *
 * `removeClippedSubviews` is pinned off. Android defaults it on, and it detaches
 * off-screen children — which breaks shadows and any absolutely positioned overlay
 * inside a row.
